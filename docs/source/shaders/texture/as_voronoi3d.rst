asVoronoi3D
***********

A procedural 3D Worley :cite:`d-Worley:1996:CTB:237170.237267` like noise shader, that outputs not only the resulting color, but the four nearest features to the evaluated point, their respective positions, and their cell color IDs. See also :cite:`d-Ebert:2002:TMP:572337`.

Parameters
----------

.. bogus directive to silence warning::

-----

Color Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Color 1*:
    Primary cell color.

*Color 2*:
    Secondary cell color.

*Contrast*:
    Contrast between primary and secondary cell color.

-----

Recursion Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Amplitude*:
    Controls the amplitute at each octave, including the starting iteration.

*Octaves*:
    Number of iterations to perform, higher values lead to increasing detail, but increased computational cost as well.

*Lacunarity*:
    Defines how large the gaps are in the cell noise with increasing octaves, higher values lead to higher gaps, lower values to small gaps.

*Persistence*:
    The persistence of the fractal is a gain factor to apply to the amplitude at each iteration, but it only has an effect when the shader is set to the mode *pebbles*.

-----

Cell Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Density*:
    The density of the cells, with higher values resulting in a higher number of cells in the same area.

*Jittering*:
    How random the placement of the cells is, with low values resulting in a ordered grid of cells, and higher values resulting in aleatory placement of cells.

*Metric*:
    Which metric to choose to calculate the distance from cell to feature points. There are several to choose from, resulting in different types of patterns.

* Euclidian distance
* Sum of square difference
* Tchebychev distance
* Sum of absolute difference
* Akritean distance
* Minkowski metric
* Karlsruhe metric

The sum of the square difference is also known as the Manhattan metric.

The Minkowski metric is a generalized metric whose P parameter allows you to go from the Euclidian distance when P has a value of 2, to the Manhattan distance when P has a value of 1, and as P reaches infinity, it represents the Tchebychev metric.

The Akritean distance if a weighted mix of the Euclidian distance, and the Tchebychev distance.

The Karlsruhe metric, also known as Moscow metric, is a radial metric, returns radial sections from a cell at the center.

*Minkowski Parameter*:
    Controls the metric, with a value of 1 being the Manhattan distance, 2 being the Euclidian distance, and higher values tending to the Tchebychev metric as the parameter approaches infinity.

*Coverage*:
    The Akritean distance coverage, or the weighting mix between the Euclidian distance and the Tchebychev distance.

*Features Mode*:
    The features mode to use when computing the output color.

* Feature 1, or nearest feature from the cell
* Feature 2, or second nearest feature from the cell
* Feature 3, or third nearest feature from the cell
* Feature 4, or fourth nearest feature from the cell
* F1 + F2, or sum of first and second nearest features
* F2 - F1, or difference between second and first nearest features
* F1 * F2, or product of first and second nearest features
* F1 / F2, or division of first nearest feature by second nearest feature
* F1 ^ F2, nearest feature raised to the second nearest feature
* Pebbles, a mode that resembles pebbles
* Cell ID 1, the ID of the nearest feature to the cell
* Cell ID 2, the ID of the second nearest feature to the cell
* Cell ID 3, the ID of the third nearest feature to the cell
* Cell ID 4, the ID of the fourth nearest feature to the cell

.. note::

   The unmodified features, points and their color IDs are also output from the shader, giving the user greater creative potential. The feature modes above are but a starting point.

-----

Color Balance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The standard Maya color balance, gain, offset parameters. Please consult Maya's documentation for more information on these controls.

-----

Effects
^^^^^^^

The standard Maya effects parameters. Please consult Maya's documentation for more information on these controls.

-----

Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^

Typically, the *placement 3d* node's placement matrix, which provides a placement matrix to transform the surface point providing the x,y,z coordinates.
By default this point is the global primitive variable **P**, but the user can override this if needed.

-----

Outputs
^^^^^^^

*Output Color*:
    The color resulting from ghe *Features Mode* choice.

*Output Alpha*:
    The alpha resulting from the *Features Mode* choice, usually luminance of the color only.

*Output Features*:
    An array of 4 floats, containing the four nearest features to the cell.

*Output Positions*:
    An array of 4 points, containing the center of the four nearest features to the cell.

*Output IDs*:
    An array of 4 colors, containing the color IDs of the four nearest features to the cell.

.. warning:: presently OSL does not allow connections from/to array elements, and appleseed-maya is not enabling the array outputs for now. This will be addressed in a future release.
