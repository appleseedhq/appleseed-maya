Parameters
----------

.. bogus directive to silence warnings::

-----

Surface Transmittance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Transmittance Color*:
    Transmittance color.

*Transmittance Amount*:
    Transmittance amount, with a value of 0 meaning no light reaches the glass medium, and a value of 1.0 meaning a full amount reaching the glass medium. This is useful for compositing the glass BSDF with other BxDFs.

-----

Specular Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Reflection Tint*:
    Overall tint for the reflection (BRDF) component of the glass BSDF.

*Refraction Tint*:
    Overall tint for the refraction (BTDF) component of the glass BSDF.  

*Index of Refraction*:
    Absolute index of refraction

*Distribution*:
    Microfacet distribution function, it can be

    1. *Beckmann* :cite:`a-Cook:1982:RMC:357290.357293`
    2. *GGX* :cite:`a-heitz:hal-00996995` 
    3. *Student's t* :cite:`a-10.1111:cgf.13137`

*Roughness*:
    The apparent surface roughness, affecting both the reflection and refraction equally.

*Specular Spread*:
    Specular highlights spread. This controls the *tails* of the specular highlights, with high values producing a softer looking highlights, and lower values producing sharper looking highlights.
    
.. note:: This parameter is valid only for the Student's t distribution only. Higher values approach the GGX distribution, and lower spread values, therefore sharper highlights, approach the Beckmann distribution.

*Anisotropy Amount*:
    Overall intensity of the anisotropy effect, with a value of 0.0 representing isotropic specular highlights.

*Anisotropy Angle*:
    Rotation angle for the anisotropic highlights, with the value in [0,1] range mapping to a rotation from 0 to 360 degrees.

*Anisotropy Vector Map*:
    Also known as tangent field, encodes the anisotropy directions along X and Y in the Red and Green or Red and Blue channels of the image. Appleseed expects values encoded in the Red and Green channels.

-----

Volume Material Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Volume Transmittance*:
    Color of the volumetric absorption as the refracted ray travels within the medium.

*Transmittance Distance*:
    The distance at which full absorption is supposed to occur. When this distance is set to 0, no absorption takes place. Lower values imply a stronger absorption, and higher values imply a weaker absorption effect as the ray would need to travel a greater distance for full absorption to take place.

-----

Bump Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Bump Normal*:
    The unit length world space normal of the bumped surface.

.....

Advanced Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Ray Depth*:
    The maximum ray depth a ray is allowed to bounce before being terminated.

-----

Outputs
^^^^^^^

*Output Color*:
    The BSDF output color.

*Output Transparency*:
    The output transparency.

-----

.. note:: The output transparency is unused at the moment.
