*Normalize by Area*

-----

.. _label_as_toon_specular_parameters:

Specular Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Specular Weight*
    The amount of specular highlights to add to the shading, between 0 and 1.

*Specular Roughness*
    The apparent surface roughness of the specular highlights. This works in conjunction with the *Specular Softness* parameter to determine the softness of transition from highlights to non lit area. 
    If you want soft highlights, increase roughness and *Specular Softness*.
    If you want bigger yet sharper highlights, increase roughness and keep the *Specular Softness* low.

*Index of Refraction*
    The index of refraction for the specular term, with high values increasing the reflectivity, and low values decreasing it. This also works in conjunction with the *Specular Softness* control.

Anisotropy
~~~~~~~~~~

*Anisotropy Amount*
    Overall intensity of the anisotropy, with a value of 0.0 representing a isotropic specular highlight, and 1.0 fully anisotropic along the main anisotropy direction.

*Anisotropy Angle*
    Rotation angle for the anisotropic highlight in [0,1], mapping a rotation from 0 to 360 degrees.

*Anisotropy Mode*
    Toggles between accepting a direct texture map in the form of an anisotropy vector map, or between an explicit vector (or a connection to a node that generates such a vector [#]_ ).
    It can take the values

        * Anisotropy Map
        * Explicit Vector

*Anisotropy Map*
    Also known as tangent field, encodes the anisotropy directions along X and Y in the Red and Green or Red and Blue channels of the image. Appleseed expects values encoded in the Red and Green channels. Valid when the *Anisotropy Mode* is set to *Anisotropy Map* only.

*Anisotropy Direction*
    The explicit vector passed as the anisotropy direction. Valid when the *Anisotropy Mode* is set to *Explicit Vector* only.        

Toon Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Specular Tint*
    The color for the specular term.

*Blending Mode*
    The blending mode for the *Specular Tint* parameter. It can be one of the following modes:

        * Darken
        * Multiply
        * Color Burn
        * Linear Burn
        * Lighten
        * Screen
        * Color Dodge
        * Linear Dodge
        * Overlay
        * Soft Light
        * Hard Light
        * Vivid Light
        * Linear Light
        * Pin Light
        * Difference
        * Exclusion
        * Subtract
        * Divide
        * Hue
        * Saturation
        * Color
        * Luminosity

.. seealso::

   The node :ref:`asBlendColor <label_as_blend_color>` for more details.

*Glossy Color*
    The color to use for the specular highlights.

*Glossy Level*
    The threshold at which to transition from specular highlights to areas without specular highlights.

*Glossy Softness*
    The transition softness between the highlights and areas without highlights. This works in conjunction with *Specular Roughness*, since a very rough specular highlight will still look sharp if the threshold between the lit areas have a harsh transition.
    On the other side this gives the user the ability to increase the size of the specular highlights, or decrease them, and vary their apparent softness independently.

*Facing Attenuation*
    A viewer Fresnel based attenuation factor. Higher values decrease the intensity of the specular reflection towards the viewer.

Advanced
~~~~~~~~

*Specular Ray Depth*
    The maximum number of specular bounces allowed for *specular* paths.

-----

Bump Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Bump Normal*
    The unit length world space normal of the bumped surface.

*Specular Normal*
    When using separate bump controls for the diffuse and specular terms, this is the unit lenght world space normal for the specular term.

*Bump Control*
    This allows the user to choose a single bump effect for both the diffuse and specular terms, or a separate bump effect for these terms. When using both, the *Bump Normal* parameter affects both terms.
    It can take the following values accordingly:
