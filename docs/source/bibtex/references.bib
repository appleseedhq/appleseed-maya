While the volumetric emission of plasma, i.e. flames, has been discussed numerous times, and while the emission characteristics of entire luminaires can be handled via IESNA profiles, the exact appearance of glowing solid objects appears to have eluded detailed scrutiny so far. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical background to thermally induced light emission of objects, describe how one can handle this behaviour with very little effort in a physically based rendering system, and provide examples for the visual importance of handling this in a plausible fashion.},

The technique allows the use of simpler scene geometry and can even improve rendering time in some images. The algorithm can be easily added into an existing ray tracer and makes no assumptions about the drawing primitives that have been implemented. }
